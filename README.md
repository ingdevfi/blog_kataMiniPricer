A solution to https://ingdevfi.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/kata-finance-le-minipricer/

This code is one solution to MiniPricer Kata that I wrote on my blog. This one solution, not The solution. We wrotte this solution with my teamate Roman CHPARSKI and our agile coach Bernard NOTARIANNI during some dojo session. We made some choices, but try to do it in most TDD mindset. Roman and I are not TDD experts, just some guys that try to learn.

This only the final step, but you can see in tests almost each every steps.
We used:
- C# as language
- NUnit as test framework
- Moq as mock framework
- NCrunch to monitor test as we writting it
- Our brains for the rest ;-)
